# Introduction

This project aims to create a microservice that synchronizes XML data from suppliers, including product stock and prices. We often face challenges in keeping our data up-to-date due to the volume of data and the rapid changes from some suppliers. This microservice will address these issues by regularly fetching XML data, storing it locally, and pushing updates to our system when changes occur. Additionally, we will explore ways to simplify the process of adding new suppliers.
